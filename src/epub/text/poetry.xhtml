			<p>
				<span>Kind solace in a dying hour!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such, father, is not (now) my theme⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not madly deem that power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of Earth may shrive me of the sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Unearthly pride hath revelled in⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have no time to dote or dream:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You call it hope⁠—that fire of fire!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is but agony of desire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I <em>can</em> hope⁠—O God! I can⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its fount is holier⁠—more divine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would not call thee fool, old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But such is not a gift of thine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Know thou the secret of a spirit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bowed from its wild pride into shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O yearning heart! I did inherit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy withering portion with the fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The searing glory which hath shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the Jewels of my throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Halo of Hell! and with a pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not Hell shall make me fear again⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O craving heart, for the lost flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sunshine of my summer hours!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ undying voice of that dead time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its interminable chime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rings, in the spirit of a spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon thy emptiness⁠—a knell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I have not always been as now:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fevered diadem on my brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I claimed and won usurpingly⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath not the same fierce heirdom given</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rome to the Caesar⁠—this to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The heritage of a kingly mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a proud spirit which hath striven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Triumphantly with human kind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On mountain soil I first drew life:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mists of the Taglay have shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nightly their dews upon my head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, I believe, the wingèd strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tumult of the headlong air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have nestled in my very hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So late from Heaven⁠—that dew⁠—it fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(’Mid dreams of an unholy night)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon me with the touch of Hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the red flashing of the light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From clouds that hung, like banners, o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared to my half-closing eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pageantry of monarchy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the deep trumpet-thunder’s roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came hurriedly upon me, telling</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of human battle, where my voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My own voice, silly child!⁠—was swelling</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">(O! how my spirit would rejoice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leap within me at the cry)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The battle-cry of Victory!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The rain came down upon my head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unsheltered⁠—and the heavy wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was but man, I thought, who shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laurels upon me: and the rush⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The torrent of the chilly air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gurgled within my ear the crush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of empires⁠—with the captive’s prayer⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hum of suitors⁠—and the tone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of flattery ’round a sovereign’s throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My passions, from that hapless hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Usurped a tyranny which men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have deemed since I have reached to power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">My innate nature⁠—be it so:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, father, there lived one who, then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then⁠—in my boyhood⁠—when their fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Burned with a still intenser glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For passion must, with youth, expire)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">E’en <em>then</em> who knew this iron heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In woman’s weakness had a part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I have no words⁠—alas!⁠—to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loveliness of loving well!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor would I now attempt to trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more than beauty of a face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose lineaments, upon my mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are ⸻ shadows on th’ unstable wind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus I remember having dwelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some page of early lore upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With loitering eye, till I have felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The letters⁠—with their meaning⁠—melt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fantasies⁠—with none.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O, she was worthy of all love!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love as in infancy was mine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas such as angel minds above</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might envy; her young heart the shrine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On which my ev’ry hope and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were incense⁠—then a goodly gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">For they were childish and upright⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pure⁠—as her young example taught:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why did I leave it, and, adrift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Trust to the fire within, for light?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We grew in age⁠—and love⁠—together⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roaming the forest, and the wild;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My breast her shield in wintry weather⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when the friendly sunshine smiled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she would mark the opening skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><em>I</em> saw no Heaven⁠—but in her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young Love’s first lesson is⁠—the heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ’mid that sunshine, and those smiles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, from our little cares apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And laughing at her girlish wiles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d throw me on her throbbing breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pour my spirit out in tears⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was no need to speak the rest⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No need to quiet any fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her⁠—who asked no reason why,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But turned on me her quiet eye!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet <em>more</em> than worthy of the love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My spirit struggled with, and strove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, on the mountain peak, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambition lent it a new tone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had no being⁠—but in thee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The world, and all it did contain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the earth⁠—the air⁠—the sea⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its joy⁠—its little lot of pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was new pleasure⁠—the ideal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dim, vanities of dreams by night⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dimmer nothings which were real⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Shadows⁠—and a more shadowy light!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parted upon their misty wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And, so, confusedly, became</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thine image, and⁠—a name⁠—a name!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two separate⁠—yet most intimate things.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I was ambitious⁠—have you known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The passion, father? You have not:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cottager, I marked a throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of half the world as all my own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And murmured at such lowly lot⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, just like any other dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Upon the vapor of the dew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My own had past, did not the beam</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of beauty which did while it thro’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The minute⁠—the hour⁠—the day⁠—oppress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mind with double loveliness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We walked together on the crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a high mountain which looked down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afar from its proud natural towers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of rock and forest, on the hills⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shouting with a thousand rills.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I spoke to her of power and pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But mystically⁠—in such guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she might deem it naught beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The moment’s converse; in her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I read, perhaps too carelessly⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mingled feeling with my own⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flush on her bright cheek, to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed to become a queenly throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too well that I should let it be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Light in the wilderness alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I wrapped myself in grandeur then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And donned a visionary crown⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet it was not that Fantasy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had thrown her mantle over me⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that, among the rabble⁠—men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Lion ambition is chained down⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crouches to a keeper’s hand⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not so in deserts where the grand⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wild⁠—the terrible conspire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their own breath to fan his fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Look ’round thee now on Samarkand!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is not she queen of Earth? her pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above all cities? in her hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their destinies? in all beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glory which the world hath known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands she not nobly and alone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falling⁠—her veriest stepping-stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall form the pedestal of a throne⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And who her sovereign? Timour⁠—he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom the astonished people saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striding o’er empires haughtily</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A diademed outlaw!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O, human love! thou spirit given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which fall’st into the soul like rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the Siroc-withered plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, failing in thy power to bless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But leav’st the heart a wilderness!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Idea! which bindest life around</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With music of so strange a sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beauty of so wild a birth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell! for I have won the Earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Hope, the eagle that towered, could see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No cliff beyond him in the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His pinions were bent droopingly⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And homeward turned his softened eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas sunset: when the sun will part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There comes a sullenness of heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him who still would look upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glory of the summer sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That soul will hate the ev’ning mist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So often lovely, and will list</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sound of the coming darkness (known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To those whose spirits hearken) as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, in a dream of night, <em>would</em> fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But <em>can not</em>, from a danger nigh.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What tho’ the moon⁠—tho’ the white moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shed all the splendor of her noon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><em>Her</em> smile is chilly⁠—and <em>her</em> beam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that time of dreariness, will seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(So like you gather in your breath)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A portrait taken after death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And boyhood in a summer sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose waning is the dreariest one⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all we live to know is known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all we seek to keep hath flown⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the noonday beauty⁠—which is all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I reached my home⁠—my home no more⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all had flown who made it so.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I passed from out its mossy door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, tho’ my tread was soft and low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A voice came from the threshold stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one whom I had earlier known⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O! I defy thee, Hell, to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On beds of fire that burn below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A humbler heart⁠—a deeper woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Father, I firmly do believe⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I <em>know</em>⁠—for Death, who comes for me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">From regions of the blest afar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where there is nothing to deceive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Hath left his iron gate ajar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rays of truth you cannot see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are flashing thro’ Eternity⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I do believe that Eblis hath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A snare in every human path⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else how, when in the holy grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wandered of the idol, Love⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who daily scents his snowy wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With incense of burnt-offerings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the most unpolluted things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above with trellised rays from Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mote may shun⁠—no tiniest fly⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The light’ning of his eagle eye⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How was it that Ambition crept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unseen, amid the revels there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the tangles of Love’s very hair?</span>

					<span>But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To those who hear not for their beating hearts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unguided Love hath fallen⁠—’mid “tears of perfect moan.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was a goodly spirit⁠—he who fell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wanderer by mossy-mantled well⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gazer on the lights that shine above⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What wonder? For each star is eye-like there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And looks so sweetly down on Beauty’s hair⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they, and ev’ry mossy spring were holy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The night had found (to him a night of woe)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here sate he with his love⁠—his dark eye bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eagle gaze along the firmament:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now turn’d it upon her⁠—but ever then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It trembled to the orb of <strong>Earth</strong> again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How lovely ’tis to look so far away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She seem’d not thus upon that autumn eve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I left her gorgeous halls⁠—nor mourned to leave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That eve⁠—that eve⁠—I should remember well⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sun-ray dropped, in Lemnos with a spell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On th’ Arabesque carving of a gilded hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on my eyelids⁠—O, the heavy light!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How drowsily it weighed them into night!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But O, that light!⁠—I slumbered⁠—Death, the while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stole o’er my senses in that lovely isle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So softly that no single silken hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awoke that slept⁠—or knew that he was there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The last spot of Earth’s orb I trod upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was a proud temple called the Parthenon;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>More beauty clung around her columned wall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than even thy glowing bosom beats withal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when old Time my wing did disenthral</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence sprang I⁠—as the eagle from his tower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And years I left behind me in an hour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time upon her airy bounds I hung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One half the garden of her globe was flung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unrolling as a chart unto my view⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tenantless cities of the desert too!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And half I wish’d to be again of men.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My Angelo! and why of them to be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And greener fields than in yon world above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And women’s loveliness⁠—and passionate love.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps my brain grew dizzy⁠—but the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I left so late was into chaos hurled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rolled a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fell⁠—not swiftly as I rose before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with a downward, tremulous motion thro’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor long the measure of my falling hours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For nearest of all stars was thine to ours⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“We came⁠—and to thy Earth⁠—but not to us</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be given our lady’s bidding to discuss:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We came, my love; around, above, below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod</span>
					<br/>
					<span><em>She</em> grants to us, as granted by her God⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Angelo, than thine gray Time unfurled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never his fairy wing o’er fairer world!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone could see the phantom in the skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Headlong thitherward o’er the starry sea⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when its glory swell’d upon the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As glowing Beauty’s bust beneath man’s eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We paused before the heritage of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy star trembled⁠—as doth Beauty then!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The night that waned and waned and brought no day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.</span>

				<span>Not long ago, the writer of these lines,</span>

				<span>In the mad pride of intellectuality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maintained “the power of words”⁠—denied that ever</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:</span>

				<span>And now, as if in mockery of that boast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two words⁠—two foreign soft dissyllables⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Italian tones, made only to be murmured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By angels dreaming in the moonlit “dew</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best</span>

				<span>Have gone to their eternal rest.</span>

				<span>Up domes⁠—up spires⁠—up kingly halls⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up fanes⁠—up Babylon-like walls⁠—</span>

				<span>At midnight in the month of June,</span>
				<br/>

				<span>An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exhales from out her golden rim,</span>

				<span>And, softly dripping, drop by drop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the quiet mountain top,</span>

				<span>Steals drowsily and musically</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the universal valley.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rosemary nods upon the grave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lily lolls upon the wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapping the fog about its breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ruin moulders into rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking like Lethe, see! the lake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A conscious slumber seems to take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would not, for the world, awake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All Beauty sleeps!⁠—and lo! where lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Her casement open to the skies)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Irene, with her Destinies!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, lady bright! can it be right⁠—</span>

				<span>The wanton airs, from the tree-top,</span>

				<span>Laughingly through the lattice drop⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flit through thy chamber in and out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wave the curtain canopy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fitfully⁠—so fearfully⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the closed and fringèd lid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That o’er the floor and down the wall,</span>

				<span>Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?</span>

				<span>As it is lasting, so be deep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soft may the worms about her creep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in the forest, dim and old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her may some tall vault unfold⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some vault that oft hath flung its black</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wingèd panels fluttering back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Triumphant, o’er the crested palls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her grand family funerals⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some sepulchre, remote, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against whose portal she hath thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In childhood many an idle stone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some tomb from out whose sounding door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She ne’er shall force an echo more,</span>

				<span>Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!</span>

				<br/>
				<span>In the monarch Thought’s dominion⁠—</span>

				<span>In state his glory well befitting,</span>

				<span class="i1">The ruler of the realm was seen.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of some one gently rapping⁠—rapping at my chamber door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Only this and nothing more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eagerly I wished the morrow;⁠—vainly I had sought to borrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my books surcease of sorrow⁠—sorrow for the lost Lenore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Nameless here for evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrilled me⁠—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">This it is, and nothing more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so faintly you came tapping⁠—tapping at my chamber door⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I scarce was sure I heard you”⁠—here I opened wide the door:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Darkness there and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Merely this and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">’Tis the wind and nothing more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though its answer little meaning⁠—little relevancy bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">With such name as “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing farther then he uttered⁠—not a feather then he fluttered⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I scarcely more than muttered, “Other friends have flown before⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the morrow <em>he</em> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Of⁠—‘Never⁠—nevermore.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3"><em>She</em> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee⁠—by these angels he hath sent thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Respite⁠—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!⁠—prophet still, if bird or devil!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this home by Horror haunted⁠—tell me truly, I implore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is there⁠—<em>is</em> there balm in Gilead?⁠—tell me⁠—tell me, I implore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!⁠—prophet still, if bird or devil!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By that Heaven that bends above us⁠—by that God we both adore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave my loneliness unbroken!⁠—quit the bust above my door!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lamplight o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Shall be lifted⁠—nevermore!</span>

				<span>The skies they were ashen and sober;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The leaves they were crispèd and sere⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The leaves they were withering and sere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was night in the lonesome October</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of my most immemorial year;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the misty mid region of Weir⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here once, through an alley Titanic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These were days when my heart was volcanic</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the scoriac rivers that roll⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the lavas that restlessly roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the ultimate climes of the pole⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the realms of the boreal pole.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our talk had been serious and sober,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But our thoughts they were palsied and sere⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Our memories were treacherous and sere⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we knew not the month was October,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And we marked not the night of the year⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We noted not the dim lake of Auber⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">(Though once we had journeyed down here)⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now, as the night was senescent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And star-dials pointed to morn⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the sun-dials hinted of morn⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the end of our path a liquescent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And nebulous lustre was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of which a miraculous crescent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Arose with a duplicate horn⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Astarte’s bediamonded crescent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Distinct with its duplicate horn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I said⁠—“She is warmer than Dian:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She rolls through an ether of sighs⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She revels in a region of sighs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She has seen that the tears are not dry on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">These cheeks, where the worm never dies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And has come past the stars of the Lion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To point us the path to the skies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the Lethean peace of the skies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come up, in despite of the Lion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To shine on us with her bright eyes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come up through the lair of the Lion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With love in her luminous eyes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Psyche, uplifting her finger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Said⁠—“Sadly this star I mistrust⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her pallor I strangely mistrust⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, hasten!⁠—oh, let us not linger!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Oh, fly!⁠—let us fly!⁠—for we must.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In terror she spoke, letting sink her</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Wings till they trailed in the dust⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In agony sobbed, letting sink her</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Plumes till they trailed in the dust⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I replied⁠—“This is nothing but dreaming:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Let us on by this tremulous light!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Let us bathe in this crystalline light!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its Sybillic splendor is beaming</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With Hope and in Beauty to-night⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">See!⁠—it flickers up the sky through the night!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And be sure it will lead us aright⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We safely may trust to a gleaming</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That can not but guide us aright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And tempted her out of her gloom⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And conquered her scruples and gloom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we passed to the end of the vista,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But were stopped by the door of a tomb⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">By the door of a legended tomb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I said⁠—“What is written, sweet sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">On the door of this legended tomb?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She replied⁠—“Ulalume⁠—Ulalume⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">’Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then my heart it grew ashen and sober</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the leaves that were crispèd and sere⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As the leaves that were withering and sere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I cried⁠—“It was surely October</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">On <em>this</em> very night of last year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That I journeyed⁠—I journeyed down here⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That I brought a dread burden down here!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">On this night of all nights in the year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Ah, what demon has tempted me here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This misty mid region of Weir⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>I saw thee once⁠—once only⁠—years ago:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must not say <em>how</em> many⁠—but <em>not</em> many.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was a July midnight; and from out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the upturn’d faces of a thousand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gave out, in return for the love-light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clad all in white, upon a violet bank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on thine own, upturn’d⁠—alas, in sorrow!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That bade me pause before that garden-gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only thee and me⁠—(O Heaven!⁠—O God!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only thee and me. I paused⁠—I looked⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in an instant all things disappeared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pearly lustre of the moon went out:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mossy banks and the meandering paths,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The happy flowers and the repining trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were seen no more: the very roses’ odors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Died in the arms of the adoring airs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All⁠—all expired save thee⁠—save less than thou:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only the divine light in thine eyes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw but them⁠—they were the world to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw but them⁠—saw only them for hours⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw only them until the moon went down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How silently serene a sea of pride!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How daring an ambition! yet how deep⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fathomless a capacity for love!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst glide away. <em>Only thine eyes remained.</em></span>
				<br/>
				<span>They <em>would not</em> go⁠—they never yet have gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><em>They</em> have not left me (as my hopes have) since.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They follow me⁠—they lead me through the years.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are my ministers⁠—yet I their slave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their office is to illumine and enkindle⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My duty, <em>to be saved</em> by their bright light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And purified in their electric fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sanctified in their elysian fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And are far up in Heaven⁠—the stars I kneel to</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sad, silent watches of my night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While even in the meridian glare of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see them still⁠—two sweetly scintillant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!</span>

			<p>
				<span>It was many and many a year ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In a kingdom by the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That a maiden lived whom you may know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">By the name of <b>Annabel Lee</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this maiden she lived with no other thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Than to love and be loved by me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><em>I</em> was a child and <em>she</em> was a child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we loved with a love that was more than love⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I and my <b>Annabel Lee</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Coveted her and me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this was the reason that, long ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">My beautiful <b>Annabel Lee</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that her highborn kinsmen came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And bore her away from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shut her up in a sepulchre</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The angels, not half so happy in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Went envying her and me⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes!⁠—that was the reason (as all men know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Chilling and killing my <b>Annabel Lee</b>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of those who were older than we⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of many far wiser than we⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And neither the angels in heaven above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor the demons down under the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the beautiful <b>Annabel Lee</b>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the beautiful <b>Annabel Lee</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of the beautiful <b>Annabel Lee</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In her sepulchre there by the sea⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In her tomb by the side of the sea.</span>

				<span>Thank Heaven! the crisis⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The danger is past,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Sadly, I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am shorn of my strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no muscle I move</span>

				<span>But no matter!⁠—I feel</span>

				<span class="i1">In a different bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, to <em>sleep</em>, you must slumber</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In just such a bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My tantalized spirit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here blandly reposes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetting, or never</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Regretting its roses⁠—</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of myrtles and roses:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For now, while so quietly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lying, it fancies</span>

				<span>A holier odor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About it, of pansies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rosemary odor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Commingled with pansies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rue and the beautiful</span>

				<span class="i1">Puritan pansies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so it lies happily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bathing in many</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dream of the truth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the beauty of Annie⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drowned in a bath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the tresses of Annie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She tenderly kissed me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She fondly caressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I fell gently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sleep on her breast⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeply to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the heaven of her breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the light was extinguished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She covered me warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she prayed to the angels</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To keep me from harm⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the queen of the angels</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shield me from harm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I lie so composedly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now in my bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Knowing her love)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you fancy me dead⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I rest so contentedly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now in my bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(With her love at my breast)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you fancy me dead⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you shudder to look at me,</span>

				<span class="i1">Thinking me dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But my heart it is brighter</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than all of the many</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stars in the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For it sparkles with Annie⁠—</span>

				<span>Thou wouldst be loved?⁠—then let thy heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From its present pathway part not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being everything which now thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be nothing which thou art not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So with the world thy gentle ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy grace, thy more than beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be an endless theme of praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And love a simple duty.</span>
